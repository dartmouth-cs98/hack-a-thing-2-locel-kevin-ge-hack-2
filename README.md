#  NLP Analysis
### Topics: text cleaning, EDA, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, text generation
## By: Kevin Ge

### What I attempted to build
I attempted to find data, clean it, conduct EDA on it, find trends in sentiment for comedians over their routines, find overall sentiment for comedians, find key topics (explored via a few approaches) in each comedy routine, and generate new comedy routine sketches using markov chains. 

### Inspire for future Ideas
I can build a markov chain and feed it any script, like Trump speaking or the Office transcripts or even children just bantering and I can use these chains to synthezie new information. This is super easy to do, and the output of these are hilarious. Secondly, I can now conduct sentiment analysis on politicans and see where their minds are (basically reading their tone) and see what topics they are talking about more or talking about less. This is especailly important for my project because we need to find key issues per politican so voters know what the local officials care about. 

### What I learned
Well, firstly, I now know how to do EDA and text cleaning. This was far more complex and time consuming than I had originally anticiapted. Secondly, I can now really easily create new sentences using any base of text as the "substrate" from which the new text will come from. Thirdly, I now know how to analyze sentiment in text. Lastly, I now know how to find topics in text. 

### To use the code in this repository
I think I built all the needed files already so the initial setup may not be needed for a user downloading this repository 

### Who did what
I worked alone and did everything myself. 

### What Didn't Work
I was able to build what I attempted using the tutorial and corresponding code. 

### Honor Code
As I said in hack-a-thing-1, I essentially followed the instructor in the youtube video step-by-step and really didn't add any of my own unique code but I think that's to be expected given the nature of these tutorials. As always, let me know if any of this is a concern and I can redo this tutorial with the knowledge I know have in case anything here violates the honor code.
